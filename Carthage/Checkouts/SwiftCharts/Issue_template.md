Please open an issue only to report bugs or if you are going to contribute and have problems understanding the internals.

If you need help:

1. Read the wiki.
2. Run the examples - a good start when something isn't working is first modifying one of the examples to do what you want, then move to your actual project.
3. Search through the issues.
4. Dig in the source code - it's fairly accessible and it shouldn't be difficult to figure out what's going on by just reading it or debugging.
5. Ask in StackOverflow!

Thanks!
